# Quality Gates & Scoring Rubrics

## Thresholds

- **80/100 = Commit** -- good enough to save
- **90/100 = PR** -- ready for deployment
- **95/100 = Excellence** -- aspirational

## Quarto Slides (.qmd)

| Severity | Issue | Deduction |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Critical | Compilation failure | -100 |
| Critical | Equation overflow | -20 |
| Critical | Broken citation | -15 |
| Critical | Typo in equation | -10 |
| Major | Text overflow | -5 |
| Major | TikZ label overlap | -5 |
| Major | Notation inconsistency | -3 |
| Minor | Font size reduction | -1 per slide |
| Minor | Long lines (>100 chars) | -1 (EXCEPT documented math formulas) |

## R Scripts (.R)

| Severity | Issue | Deduction |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Critical | Syntax errors | -100 |
| Critical | Domain-specific bugs | -30 |
| Critical | Hardcoded absolute paths | -20 |
| Major | Missing set.seed() | -10 |
| Major | Missing figure generation | -5 |

## Beamer Slides (.tex)

| Severity | Issue | Deduction |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Critical | XeLaTeX compilation failure | -100 |
| Critical | Undefined citation | -15 |
| Critical | Overfull hbox > 10pt | -10 |

## Enforcement

- **Score < 80:** Block commit. List blocking issues.
- **Score < 90:** Allow commit, warn. List recommendations.
- User can override with justification.

## Quality Reports

Generated **only at merge time**. Use `templates/quality-report.md` for format.
Save to `quality_reports/merges/YYYY-MM-DD_[branch-name].md`.

## Tolerance Thresholds (Econometrics)

| Quantity | Tolerance | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Point estimates | 1e-6 | Numerical precision of OLS/IV estimators |
| Standard errors | 1e-4 | Rounding in robust/cluster SE computation |
| t-statistics | 1e-3 | Derived quantity, tolerance propagates |
| p-values | 1e-4 | Sensitive to tail approximation |
| Coverage rates | +/- 0.01 | MC variability with B >= 1000 reps |
| R-squared | 1e-6 | Deterministic given data |
| F-statistics | 1e-3 | Derived from restricted/unrestricted models |
